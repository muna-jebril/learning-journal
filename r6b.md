 computer is a part of our life 
 and today we are going to talk about how the computer work
 how computer work ?
 computer are every where  your phone ypur smart watch  in the car . 
 whats make a computer a computer and how does it work ?
 humman since ever they build equiement that can help them in  there life to help us in manual work 
 so then they think to invent some thing  to help us in the thinking like soloving puzzel and do math and so on 
 at first when  they decided to build a thinking machien they think about diffrent task 
  take input 
  store info 
  and proceessing and give an output this sounds simple but realy its not easy so that what make the computer a computer theis for steps 
  at the begining the computer was very big in a size  of a room and tak a lot of time to do a simple mathmatic 
  computer start be being to calclate but now we use it to every thing to chat and read and watch 
  although the computer style has change but its work in the same task input  store  process and output 
    now to will talk about input 
     is what we do to make computer do stuff  like keyborad the camera and toch screean and so on 
     2-and now we are going to talk about storing we talk the info from the input and process it by algorathem and then we store it 
      output 
     the computer display  the output on divices such as screens and mobile and headset or even a printer to to make a rebot moves 
     if we are connecting to the internet the output of one computer it will be the inut for anther computer and so on 
     
    how computer wokr : binary and data 
    computer works in ones and zeros  inside the computer it has wiars and circcut that carry all the infomation 
    the singal wire it either on or off 
    and on and oof we call it a bit and it the smallest piece of inforamtion in ther computer and when we use lots of bit we can  represnt complex info 
    the binary number system 
    in the decimal number sytem we have from from 0 and 9 and in the binary we have 0 and 1 
    the number 9 in binary is 1001 
    any numbers can be reprsented in 0 and 1 
    in 8 wires we can store numbers from 0 to 255 
    and when we use 32 wire we can represnt numbers from 0 to  4 billon 
    even  text imgs and sound we also can represnted in numbers
    imgs in binary :their are made of tiny pieces of pizel and each pizels have colors and each color  can be represnted in binary 
    sound  is made of virbration and and it translate in wave form and the  wave form we can translate  it to numbers 
     circuits and logic 
     every input or output its a type on info and we can represnted in 0 and 1 
     to make info as output   its need to modfiy and combine  computer singals 
     a computer uses millons of  elctronic componet and togather we call it circtus 
    we have circuts like not that take a 0 as input and give it a 1 as input and so one and we call it a not circuts and we have more circts
    can take multiples signals like  and it will give you 1if the both are 1s and if we put 1 &0 it will give you 0 and give you 0 if you put 0&0
     why the smaal computer are faster ? 
     bec the small the computer is the less disntance the elcornaic signal have to go 
     cpu and memort and input and output 
     we say that  computer have  the same 4 thing 
     input that we take the info from diffrent input divices and we converted in binary and their is memory to store info and we have the
     cpu to process it and finaly   thier is output divices that take the info and dislay it as phical output 
     so if we ented a  leter B it will take it as input and then covet it to binary and goes to the cpu the cpu send it to the moemery and take the instraction of how to draw B in pizels 
     and then its goes back to the cpu and do the intreaction and store it in the memory and then we draw it in pixsels in the output divices 
     
    speed and the  size of memory and cpu it`s importet things in the computer to do what we need 
    ## hardwear and sofwear 
    when you look inside a computer you see circuts and chips and  wires and plug , speakers , and other stuff 
    this is the  hardwear but 
    the one yu cant see is the softwear and it is the code  that is running on this machine 
    but how to make the softwear and hardwear works togather we have to take alook at the CPU 
     is the master chips that control the other parts of the computer 
     and in the cpu we have many small circuts like circtues to do math  and logic
      and to send and recvive info from diffrent parts of the comyter 
      the magic  of the cpu that it know which circtus should use and when shuold it use it 
      the cpu recive sample command that  teel it which circut  to use 
      binary code is the most basic form of softwear and it control all the hw in the computer 
      softwear tells the cpu what to do  but when  you  are lisnting to music and chating and anther thing 
       the computer do multirtask at the same time 
       so we have to  take a look at the operating system 
        its a master program that manges how softwear  uses the hardwear of a computer 
        like windows
