funcation is a group of  statment that we put it togather to perform an spific task 
An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
evaluate condation and condation statmeant 
 thier are 2 ways 
 the first one is that  an expreasion if evaluate  which return a value 
 or a condation statemnt that decide what we do if its true or false 
 in condation statemnt we use if/else
 we use !=  that mean not equal 
 and == mean equal in value 
 and === equal in value and the type 
 and here is an example for the if statment 
 if (x>20)
 {return "pass";
 }
 else 
 {
 return "failed"
 }
 
 when we change the type of a varubale we call this rocess  type corretion
 and we will talk about the data type of java script 
 string we use it  for the text 
 number for number 
   boolean for true or false 
   null for empty value 
   undfined Variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value
   java script uses weak typing that mean we dont have to spifies the  tyoe of the varuable it will atuomactily dined the type according to the value 
   
   SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES
   we have and and it`s return true if both are true and return false if both are false or one of them at least &&
   
 2-OR (||) return true if one value at least it`s true and return false if the both are false
