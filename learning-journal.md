## MarkDown 
its an easy way for styling and formating the elements regardless  of your knowloge in HTML lanuage 
we can make the text bold or itlic and makeing headlines and adding picures and links and list(ordered , unorderd) in an easy way using some symboyls you even can add emoji.
so now im going to give you some examples for markdown 
- when you use the hash sign (#) its mean that its a header and we have 6 sizes of it starting from one hash sign (the biggest ) to six hash signs (the smallest)
*and this i how to make the text italic using the star sign *
and other examples  you can learn it later.

## What is GitHub Pages?
github helps you bulding and devolping web sites without  the need for sever or even a database and you can publish your work on it so every one can see it . its so easy  even if you dont have a background about html, you  can just bild a butiaful page and you can get the URL and publish it. 
##Basic writing and formatting syntax
now i\`ll  list  some syntax for MarkDown 
- You can quote text with a (>).like this 
> You never fail until you give up 
- you can have a link using [] and you put in it  followed by (with your URL) like this :
It\`  google where you can search for any thing you want  [google](https://www.google.com/).
- And  i already used the list like above and here is the santax :you just have to put - before the item.
